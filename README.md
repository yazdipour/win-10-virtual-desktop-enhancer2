# Windows 10 Virtual Desktop Enhancer

## News

* virtual-desktop-accessor.dll does not work with Build 21390 because of current underlying changes in Windows.
* I am archiving this project too because of many changes in Windows.
* Best Alternative and my recommendation: https://github.com/mzomparelli/zVirtualDesktop

## FORK

**0.11.3:** I updated the original repo to the config that works for me.

**NEW** Also I added Ctrl+Alt+⬅➡ shortcut to navigate between desktops easier. (With one hand)
